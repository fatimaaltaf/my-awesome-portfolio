            Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Fatima Altaf. My Software Development skills are the
            way I like my pancakes: full stack. I graduated from Lighthouse Labs
            Web Development Bootcamp in January 2020.
          </h3>
          <h5>Here are four great things about me ðŸ˜ƒ:</h5>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>I never give up:</strong> I never considered myself a
              person strong enough for STEM. In high school, I had Math and
              Chemistry teachers who discouraged me from further pursuing
              science and technology majors in University. I gravitated towards
              Political Science and I excelled. However, a part of me always
              wished I had fought harder for myself. In August of 2018, I took
              the opportunity to enroll in the Intro to Web Development course
              at Lighthouse Labs. This course was offered as part of a{" "}
              <a href="https://idrf.com/women-learn-code/">
                Women Learn to Code program (IDRF)
              </a>{" "}
              It was then I realized my potential to excel in Software
              Development. I convinced myself, "you can do this." Now I use my
              story as a teaching moment to motivate people to bring out the
              best in them.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>I have an analytical mindset:</strong> I completed six
              projects at Lighthouse Labs that took me through a range of
              tech-stacks like Node, Express, React, Ruby on Rails, EJS, and
              JQuery. I completed my{" "}
              <a href="https://github.com/fatimaaltaf/forget">
                capstone project
              </a>{" "}
              from ideation to completion in two weeks!
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>There is no 'I' in team:</strong> My{" "}
              <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/sisterhood-softball-league-1.5167469">
                softball
              </a>{" "}
              team captain always stressed the importance of playing as a single
              unit. I played outfield and realized that even though the position
              did not get the most traction, I always had to bring my A-Game and
              back up my teammates. I apply this skill when working with others
              on projects.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>My communication skills are on point:</strong> Case in
              point â€“ this list. I have written and presented for different
              audiences ({" "}
              <a href="https://ontariocampaign2000.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ONC2000_Pre-Budget-Submission-2019_Jan29.pdf">

              ). I've even made a few documentary films to convey the thoughts
              percolating in my head ðŸ’¡:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  {" "}

                  Muslim Seniors Circle)
                </li>
              </ul>
              To me writing for an array of audiences is similar to learning
              different tech-stacks.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            I decided to pursue to Software Development with the strong belief
            that I can impact the tech industry by creating products that
            break-barriers, are accessible, and user-friendly.
